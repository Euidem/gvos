## Resolved Issues

### 2026-05-27 | Phase 0 | Info | PHP/Composer/Node.js not installed on build machine

**Description:** PHP 8.2+, Composer, and Node.js were not installed on the development machine.

**Resolution:** All source files were written by hand. cPanel used as the execution environment. Node/npm not required for Phase 0/1 (Blade + Tailwind CDN).

**Status:** Resolved.

---

### 2026-05-27 | Phase 0 | High | Missing auth controllers caused composer install failure

**Description:** `routes/auth.php` referenced 9 auth controllers that did not exist. Laravel validates invokable controllers at `package:discover`, causing cPanel install to crash with `Invalid route action`.

**Resolution:** Created all 9 auth controllers as source files. Commit `54112db`.

**Status:** Resolved.

---

### 2026-05-27 | Phase 0 | High | Empty migrations directory caused seeder failure

**Description:** `database/migrations/` was completely empty. Seeder failed with `Table 'roles' doesn't exist`. `config/permission.php` was also missing.

**Resolution:** Created 4 migration files and `config/permission.php`. Commit `299dd7a`.

**Status:** Resolved.

---

### 2026-05-28 | Phase 0 | High | Blade component resolution path incorrect

**Description:** `php artisan view:cache` failed with "Unable to locate component [layouts.auth]". Files were in `resources/views/layouts/` but `<x-layouts.auth>` resolves to `resources/views/components/layouts/`.

**Resolution:** Created component files at correct location. Commit `afd12c7`.

**Status:** Resolved.

---

### 2026-05-28 | Phase 0 | High | Filament 403 after login

**Description:** After successful login, `/admin` returned 403. User model did not implement `FilamentUser` contract.

**Resolution:** Added `implements FilamentUser` and `canAccessPanel()` to User model. Commit `a476da2`.

**Status:** Resolved.

---

### 2026-05-29 | Phase 1 | Critical | Target class [role] does not exist

**Description:**
Logging in as a non-admin user (e.g. Talent) and visiting `/talent/dashboard` threw:

```
Illuminate\Contracts\Container\BindingResolutionException
Target class [role] does not exist.
```

**Root cause:** In Laravel 11, `app/Http/Kernel.php` no longer exists. Spatie Laravel Permission v6 middleware aliases (`role`, `permission`, `role_or_permission`) are **not auto-registered** in Laravel 11 — they must be declared explicitly in `bootstrap/app.php` using `$middleware->alias([...])`. The Phase 1 implementation only registered `check.status` and forgot the Spatie aliases.

**Resolution:** Added all three Spatie middleware aliases to `bootstrap/app.php`:
```php
'role'               => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
'permission'         => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\PermissionMiddleware::class,
'role_or_permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleOrPermissionMiddleware::class,
```

**Status:** Resolved — commit `[Fix Phase 1 role middleware and user form UX]`.

## Warnings / Notes

### Phase 1 | Low | Tailwind CDN in production

Using `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` is acceptable for Phase 0/1 staging. Should be replaced with a compiled Vite build in Phase 2+.

---

### Phase 1 | Low | Inertia middleware active but no React pages

`HandleInertiaRequests` runs on every web request as a no-op (Blade-only responses pass through). Harmless until React pages are introduced in Phase 2+.
