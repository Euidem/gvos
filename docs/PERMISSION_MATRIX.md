# GVOS — Permission Matrix

## Overview
Authorization is enforced at three layers:
1. **Route middleware** — Spatie `role:` middleware in `routes/web.php`
2. **Panel / resource level** — Filament `canViewAny()`, `canCreate()`, `canEdit()`, `canDelete()`
3. **Policy level** — Laravel Policies (Phase 2+)

**Default rule: DENY. Access must be explicitly granted.**

---

## Role Reference

| Friendly Label | DB Slug | Portal |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| Super Admin | `super_admin` | Filament `/admin` |
| Operations Admin | `operations_admin` | Filament `/admin` |
| Line Manager | `line_manager` | `/manager/dashboard` |
| Talent | `talent` | `/talent/dashboard` |
| Individual Client | `individual_client` | `/client/dashboard` |
| Business Client Admin | `business_client_admin` | `/client/dashboard` |
| Business Client Staff | `business_client_staff` | `/client/dashboard` |
| Active Lead | `active_lead` | `/lead/dashboard` |

---

## Middleware Aliases (Laravel 11 — `bootstrap/app.php`)

```php
$middleware->alias([
    'role'               => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
    'permission'         => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\PermissionMiddleware::class,
    'role_or_permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleOrPermissionMiddleware::class,
    'check.status'       => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckAccountStatus::class,
]);
```

> **Important:** In Laravel 11, Spatie aliases must be declared explicitly. They are NOT auto-registered.

---

## Phase 1 — Implemented Access Control

### Filament Panel (`/admin`)

| Action | super_admin | operations_admin | All others |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Access `/admin` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 |
| View Users list | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create User | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit User | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Phase 2 — People & Organizations Access Control

| Resource | super_admin | operations_admin | All others |
|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Companies | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ |
| Departments | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ |
| Client Profiles | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ |
| Talent Profiles | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ |
| Manager Profiles | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ |

> No hard delete on any Phase 2 resource. Use status changes (inactive/suspended) instead.

---

## Phase 3 — Leads & Trials Access Control

| Resource | super_admin | operations_admin | active_lead | All others |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Lead Requests | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ (view own via dashboard) | ❌ |
| Price Estimates | ✅ CRUD (incl. delete) | ✅ CRUD (incl. delete) | ❌ (view via dashboard) | ❌ |
| Trials | ✅ view/edit | ✅ view/edit | ❌ (view own via dashboard) | ❌ |
| Public form `/request-service` | ✅ (any) | ✅ (any) | ✅ (any) | ✅ (public) |

### Approve Trial Action (LeadRequestResource)
- Creates or finds a user by email from the lead request
- Assigns `active_lead` role via `syncRoles(['active_lead'])`
- Creates ClientProfile stub if missing
- Creates Trial record and links to user
- New users get a random password — must use password reset to log in

### Status Flow (Lead Request)
```
new → price_estimated → price_accepted → under_review → trial_approved
    → trial_active → trial_completed → payment_pending → converted
                                                        → lost / disqualified
```

### Status Flow (Trial)
```
pending → approved → active → completed → (payment_pending on lead)
                    → expired
                    → cancelled
```

---

## Public Routes (no auth required)

| Route | Method | Controller | Purpose |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `/request-service` | GET | LeadRequestController@show | Display lead form |
| `/request-service` | POST | LeadRequestController@store | Submit lead form |
| `/request-service/success` | GET | Closure | Success confirmation page |

---

## Phase 4 — Workspace Engine Access Control

| Resource | super_admin | operations_admin | line_manager | talent | client roles | active_lead |
|----------|------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Workspaces (Filament) | ✅ CRUD | ✅ CRUD | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Workspace Members (Filament RelationManager) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `/workspaces` (portal index) | ✅ (all) | ✅ (all) | 👁 assigned | 👁 assigned | 👁 own | 👁 trial only |
| `/workspaces/{workspace}` (portal detail) | ✅ | ✅ | 👁 if member/primary | 👁 if member/primary | 👁 if member | 👁 if trial ws |

> Workspace detail page (`/workspaces/{workspace}`) uses `Workspace::userHasAccess($user)` (model helper) which covers all tiers: admin roles, primary team, active members, and task-assigned users. See Phase 5 role resolution table.

---

## Phase 5 — Task Board Access Control

### Task Board Routes

All task routes require `auth` + `check.status` middleware. No additional `role:` middleware — access is enforced inside the controller using `Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()`.

| Action | admin/manager | talent / assigned_user | client | observer/none |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| View task list (`index`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 |
| View task detail (`show`) | ✅ | ✅ (+ task-assigned fallback) | ✅ | ❌ 403 |
| Create task (`create` / `store`) | ✅ | ✅ talent only | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| Edit task (`edit` / `update`) | ✅ | ✅ (own pending tasks only) | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| Add public comment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 |
| Add internal comment | ✅ | ❌ (forced public) | ❌ (forced public) | ❌ |
| Change task status | ✅ (any transition) | Allowed transitions only | Allowed transitions only | ❌ |
| Set internal_notes | ✅ | ❌ (stripped) | ❌ (stripped) | ❌ |

### Role Determination (`Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()`)

Centralised method on the `Workspace` model. Called by both `WorkspaceController` and `WorkspaceTaskController`. Uses `(int)` casts on both sides to avoid the Eloquent string/integer strict-comparison mismatch.

**Updated (Fix 4 — 2026-05-30): 7-tier resolution**

| Priority | Condition | Role returned |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | `super_admin` or `operations_admin` system role | `admin` |
| 2 | Active member row with `role=workspace_admin` | `workspace_admin` |
| 3 | `primary_manager_id` matches user (int-cast) | `manager` |
| 4 | Active member row with `role=manager` | `manager` |
| 5 | `primary_talent_id` matches user (int-cast) | `talent` |
| 6a | Active member row with `role=talent` | `talent` |
| 6b | Active member row with `role=client_admin` | `client_admin` |
| 6c | Active member row with `role=client_staff` | `client_staff` |
| 6d | Active member row with `role=client` (legacy) | `client_admin` |
| 6e | Active member row with `role=observer` | `observer` |
| 7 | Assigned to any task in this workspace | `assigned_user` |
| — | None of the above | `none` → 403 |

`assigned_user` is mapped to `talent` via `transitionRole()` before passing to `allowedTransitions()`.
Legacy `client` member row is mapped to `client_admin` via `transitionRole()`.

For task `show()`, a user with role `none` may still view a specific task if they are the `assigned_to_user_id` for that task — they receive effective role `talent` for display purposes only.

### Task Status Allowed Transitions

| From Status | admin/workspace_admin/manager | talent/assigned_user | client_admin | client_staff/observer |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| pending | in_progress, cancelled | in_progress | — | — |
| in_progress | blocked, submitted, pending, cancelled | blocked, submitted | — | — |
| blocked | in_progress, cancelled | in_progress | — | — |
| submitted | approved, revision_requested, in_progress | — | approved, revision_requested | — |
| revision_requested | in_progress, cancelled | in_progress | — | — |
| approved | closed | — | closed | — |
| closed | — | — | — | — |
| cancelled | — | — | — | — |

### Drag Handle Visibility (Kanban Board)

| Workspace Role | Drag Handle Shown On |
|----------------|----------------------|
| admin / workspace_admin / manager | All tasks |
| talent | Tasks assigned to self OR unassigned tasks |
| assigned_user | Only their explicitly assigned task |
| client_admin / client | Only on submitted or approved tasks |
| client_staff / observer | Never |

### Task Board Filament (WorkspaceTaskResource)

| Action | super_admin | operations_admin | All others |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| View tasks list | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Hard delete | ❌ disabled | ❌ | ❌ |
| Archive (soft delete) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## Phase 6 — Chat & File Access Control

### Workspace Chat Routes

All chat routes require `auth` + `check.status`. Access is enforced via `WorkspaceMessageController` using `Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()`.

| Action | admin/workspace_admin/manager | talent/client_admin/client_staff | observer | none |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------|------|
| View chat page (`index`) | ✅ all messages | ✅ public messages only | ✅ public only (view) | ❌ 403 |
| Post message (`store`) | ✅ any visibility | ✅ public only (forced) | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| Set `visibility=internal` on message | ✅ | ❌ (forced to public) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete own message (`destroy`) | ✅ | ✅ own only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete any message (`destroy`) | ✅ (admin/manager) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Workspace File Routes

All file routes require `auth` + `check.status`. Access is enforced via `WorkspaceFileController`.

| Action | admin/workspace_admin/manager | talent/client_admin/client_staff | observer | none |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------|------|
| View file list (`index`) | ✅ all visibility | ✅ public files only | ✅ public only (view) | ❌ 403 |
| Upload file (`store`) | ✅ any visibility | ✅ public only (forced) | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| Set `visibility=internal` on file | ✅ | ❌ (forced to public) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Download file (`download`) | ✅ all visibility | ✅ public only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete/archive file (`destroy`) | ✅ (any uploader) | ✅ own uploads only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Attach file to task (`storeForTask`) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |

### Filament Chat & Files Resources

| Action | super_admin | operations_admin | All others |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| View messages list | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create message via Filament | ❌ disabled | ❌ | ❌ |
| Moderate/remove message | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View files list | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Upload file via Filament | ❌ disabled | ❌ | ❌ |
| Archive file | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

> Portal is the source of truth for messages and files. Filament provides moderation/oversight only.

---

## Phase 7 — Time Tracking & Work Reports Access Control

### Time Log Routes (`workspaces/{workspace}/time-logs/...`)

| Route | admin | workspace_admin | manager | talent / assigned_user | client_admin | client_staff | observer |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| index | all logs | all logs | all logs | own logs only | approved+client_summary | approved+client_summary | ❌ 403 |
| create / store | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| show | any log | any log | any log | own only | approved+client_summary | approved+client_summary | ❌ |
| edit / update | any log | any log | any log | own (draft/rejected) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| review | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| destroy | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | own draft only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Phase 9 Timer Routes (`workspaces/{workspace}/time-tracker/...`)

All timer routes require `auth` + `check.status`. Access is enforced in `WorkspaceTimeTrackerController` through `Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()`.

| Route | admin | workspace_admin | manager | talent / assigned_user | client_admin | client_staff | observer / none |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `GET /time-tracker/current` | own active timer | own active timer | own active timer | own active timer | ❌ no timer use | ❌ no timer use | ❌ no timer use |
| start | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| stop own timer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| stop another user's timer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| complete own timer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |
| complete another user's timer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Timer rules:
- One running timer is enforced per user globally.
- Running logs cannot be manually edited, reviewed, or deleted until stopped.
- Completing a timer submits it for manager/admin review.
- Clients never see running timers; they still only see approved logs with `visibility=client_summary`.
- Timer JavaScript is display-only; server timestamps and server duration calculation are authoritative.

### Weekly Report Routes (`workspaces/{workspace}/reports/...`)

| Route | admin | workspace_admin | manager | talent | client_admin | client_staff | observer |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| index | all statuses | all statuses | all statuses | submitted/approved/published | published only | published only | ❌ |
| create / store | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| show | any status | any status | any status | submitted+ | published | published | ❌ |
| edit / update | draft/submitted | draft/submitted | draft/submitted | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| destroy | draft/submitted | draft/submitted | draft/submitted | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Phase 7 Filament Resources (Workspace nav group)

| Resource | View | Create | Edit | Delete | Nav sort |
|----------|------|--------|------|--------|---------|
| WorkspaceTimeLogResource | super_admin, ops_admin | ❌ (portal only) | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | 7 |
| WorkspaceWeeklyReportResource | super_admin, ops_admin | ❌ (portal only) | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | 8 |

> Client roles (client_admin, client_staff, legacy client) never access Filament admin panel.
> Time log visibility: clients see only `status=approved AND visibility=client_summary` records.
> Weekly report visibility: clients see only `status=published` records.
> Blockers and next_steps fields in weekly reports are hidden from client-role views in Blade templates.

---

## Phase 8 — Billing Access Control

### Portal Billing Routes (`workspaces/{workspace}/billing/...`)

All billing routes require `auth` + `check.status`. Access is enforced in `WorkspaceBillingController` using `Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()`.

| Route | admin | workspace_admin | manager | talent / assigned_user | client_admin | client_staff | observer / none |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| billing index | ✅ | 👁 read-only | 👁 read-only | ❌ 403 | 👁 own workspace | 👁 own workspace | ❌ 403 |
| invoice detail | ✅ | 👁 read-only | 👁 read-only | ❌ 403 | 👁 own workspace | 👁 own workspace | ❌ 403 |
| payments history | ✅ | 👁 read-only | 👁 read-only | ❌ 403 | 👁 own workspace | 👁 own workspace | ❌ 403 |

### Billing Visibility Rules

- Non-members receive 403 through the workspace access check.
- Talent, assigned_user, and observer roles do not see billing by default.
- Clients cannot see invoice `internal_notes`, internal payment confirmation metadata, or void invoices.
- Workspace admins and managers can view billing status for their workspace but cannot edit amounts or confirm payments from the portal.
- Filament remains the only write surface for billing records.

### Phase 8 Filament Resources (Billing nav group)

| Resource | View | Create | Edit | Operational actions | Delete |
|----------|------|--------|------|---------------------|--------|
| BillingPlanResource | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | Archive plan | ❌ |
| WorkspaceSubscriptionResource | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | Status/date tracking | ❌ |
| InvoiceResource | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | draft/issued/partial only | Issue, mark paid, cancel | ❌ |
| PaymentResource | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | pending only | Confirm, cancel | ❌ |

> Phase 8 is foundation only: no live gateway collection, no recurring billing job, and no payroll.

---

## Phase 10 — Password Vault Access Control

### Portal Vault Routes (`workspaces/{workspace}/vault/...`)

All vault routes require `auth` + `check.status`. Access is enforced in `WorkspaceVaultController` using `Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()` and `WorkspaceVaultItem` access helpers.

| Action | admin | workspace_admin | manager | client_admin | client_staff | talent / assigned_user | observer / none |
|--------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Vault index | all workspace items | all workspace items | all workspace items | own + explicitly allowed | explicitly allowed only | explicitly allowed only | 403 |
| Create item | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit item | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | own created only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Archive item | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | own created only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View metadata | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | own + explicitly allowed | explicitly allowed only | explicitly allowed only | ❌ |
| Reveal/copy secret | ✅ logged | ✅ logged | workspace_admins/own/explicit only, logged | own/explicit only, logged | explicit only, logged | explicit only, logged | ❌ |
| View access logs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | own created only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Vault Visibility Rules

- `secret_value` is encrypted and hidden from model serialization.
- Vault list, workspace cards, dashboards, Filament tables, audit logs, and access logs never display plaintext secrets.
- Reveal and copy actions are POST-only and log both `workspace_vault_access_logs` and `audit_logs`.
- Allowed user IDs must belong to the workspace member/primary team/task-assignee set.
- Client staff, talent, and assigned users can only access items through explicit role or user assignment.
- No auto-login, browser extension, password injection, screenshot capture, keystroke capture, or screen monitoring exists in Phase 10.

### Phase 10 Filament Resources (Workspace nav group)

| Resource | View | Create | Edit | Operational actions | Delete |
|----------|------|--------|------|---------------------|--------|
| WorkspaceVaultItemResource | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | super_admin, ops_admin | Archive, restore | ❌ |
| WorkspaceVaultAccessLogResource | super_admin, ops_admin | ❌ | ❌ | Read-only | ❌ |

---

## Phase 11 - Notifications Access Control

### Portal Notification Routes

All notification routes require `auth` + `check.status`.

| Route | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `GET /notifications` | Authenticated user sees only their own notifications |
| `POST /notifications/{id}/read` | Authenticated user can mark only their own notification as read |
| `POST /notifications/read-all` | Authenticated user marks only their own unread notifications as read |
| `GET /settings/notifications` | Authenticated user sees only their own preferences |
| `PUT /settings/notifications` | Authenticated user updates only their own preferences |

### Recipient Rules

- Task assignment notifies the assigned user.
- Task status changes notify relevant workspace managers/admins, task creator/assignee, and client-side users only for review-facing statuses.
- Internal task comments, internal messages, and internal files notify only admin/workspace_admin/manager recipients.
- Public workspace messages notify workspace members except the sender; email is disabled by default.
- Time log submissions notify managers/workspace admins, not clients.
- Published weekly reports notify client-side workspace users.
- Issued invoices notify client-side workspace users.
- Recorded/confirmed payments notify client-side workspace users and non-actor system admins where appropriate.
- Trial approval notifies the active lead user.

### Payload Safety

- Notification payloads contain only safe metadata: title, message, action_url, workspace_id, related_type, related_id, level, notification_key.
- Notification payloads do not include vault secrets, raw file paths, payment raw_payload, internal admin notes, internal invoice notes, manager notes, tokens, or API keys.
- Action URLs are generated only for recipients who should be able to access the target route.

### Phase 11 Filament Resource

| Resource | View | Create | Edit | Delete |
|----------|------|--------|------|--------|
| UserNotificationPreferenceResource | super_admin, ops_admin | no | no | no |

---

## Phase 12 - Stabilization Audit Notes

- Portal task create/edit forms now require `assigned_to_user_id` to already belong to the workspace active-member or primary-team set. This prevents task assignment from becoming an arbitrary workspace-access grant.
- Filament `WorkspaceTimeLogResource` is read-only in Phase 12. Super Admin and Operations Admin can inspect the table, but create/edit/delete actions are disabled from that resource.
- Notification mark-read routes remain current-user scoped. Mark-all-read now uses a current-user unread notification query update instead of loading all unread models.
- Workspace file lists remain workspace/visibility filtered and are paginated. Linked task data is eager-loaded to avoid per-row task lookups.
- Workspace chat remains workspace/visibility filtered and is capped to the latest 100 messages.
- No Phase 12 change loosens billing, vault, timer, notification, file, chat, task, or report access.

---

## Phase 13 - Workspace Membership and Invitations

### Portal Member Routes

All member management routes require `auth` + `check.status` except the invitation review page. Access is enforced in `WorkspaceMemberController` with `Workspace::resolveUserWorkspaceRole()`.

| Action | admin | workspace_admin | manager | client_admin | client_staff | talent / assigned_user | observer / none |
|--------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| View member page | all | own workspace | view only | own workspace | view only | team list | 403 |
| Add existing user | yes | yes | no | client_staff only | no | no | no |
| Change workspace role | yes | yes | no | client_staff only | no | no | no |
| Deactivate member | yes | yes | no | client_staff only | no | no | no |
| Create invitation | yes | yes | no | client_staff only | no | no | no |
| Resend/revoke invitation | yes | yes | no | client_staff only | no | no | no |
| Accept invitation | invited authenticated email only | invited authenticated email only | invited authenticated email only | invited authenticated email only | invited authenticated email only | invited authenticated email only | invited authenticated email only |

### Phase 13 Boundaries

- Super Admin and Operations Admin can manage all workspace membership.
- Workspace Admin can manage members in that workspace but cannot create platform super/operations admins.
- Client Admin can add or invite `client_staff` only and is restricted to the client company boundary where company data is available.
- Manager, Client Staff, Talent, and assigned users can view member context only; they cannot manage membership.
- Observer and non-member users cannot access member management.
- Membership removal sets `workspace_members.status=removed` and `removed_at`; users are not hard-deleted.
- Invitation audit logs never include the invitation token.
- Filament Workspace admin exposes separate Members and Invitations relation managers.
- Phase 13 does not change billing, payments, vault encryption, timer logic, payroll, gateways, or monitoring/surveillance features.

---

## Phase 14 - Invitation Account Activation

### Invitation Route Access

| Route | Auth Required | Who Can Use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| `GET /invitations/{token}` | No | Anyone with the link |
| `POST /invitations/{token}/accept` | Yes (auth middleware) | Logged-in user whose email matches invitation |
| `POST /invitations/{token}/register` | No | Anyone — only valid for invitations with no existing account |

### Registration Constraints

- Email is locked to the invited email — the registrant cannot choose a different one.
- Workspace role comes from the invitation — the registrant cannot change it.
- Platform role is safely inferred from workspace_role or taken from `invitation.platform_role` if set and safe.
- `super_admin` and `operations_admin` can never be assigned via invitation under any code path.
- Client admin invitations remain limited to `client_staff` workspace role.
- Workspace admin invitations infer `line_manager` platform role.

### Phase 14 Boundaries

- No token is logged in any audit event.
- No password is logged in any audit event.
- Accepted/revoked/expired invitations cannot be re-accepted.
- A logged-in user with a non-matching email cannot accept even if they POST directly.
- A duplicate active workspace membership is blocked.
- Phase 14 does not change billing, payments, vault encryption, timer logic, payroll, gateways, or monitoring/surveillance features.

## Implementation Notes

- Filament resources are protected at panel level (`canAccessPanel`) AND resource level (`canViewAny`, `canCreate`, `canEdit`, `canDelete`).
- Phase 2 Filament navigation group: "People & Organizations" (sort positions 1–5).
- Phase 3 Filament navigation group: "Leads & Trials" (sort positions 1–3).
- Phase 4 Filament navigation group: "Workspace" (sort 1). Phase 5 adds WorkspaceTaskResource (sort 2). Phase 6 adds WorkspaceFileResource (sort 4) and WorkspaceMessageResource (sort 5). Phase 7 adds WorkspaceTimeLogResource (sort 7) and WorkspaceWeeklyReportResource (sort 8). Phase 8 adds "Billing" resources: Billing Plans, Subscriptions, Invoices, Payments. Phase 10 adds WorkspaceVaultItemResource (sort 9) and WorkspaceVaultAccessLogResource (sort 10) under Workspace. Phase 11 adds UserNotificationPreferenceResource under User Management (sort 2).
- Always enforce on server — never rely on front-end hiding alone.
- Business client staff permissions are per-user, managed by Business Client Admin (Phase 4+).
- GetVirtual brand name must not appear in any visible app UI (screens, panels, dashboards, notices). Internal documentation only.
- Active leads can only see their own trial data via `/lead/dashboard` — they cannot access Filament.
- Task internal notes and internal comments are invisible to non-admin/non-manager roles — enforced in controller, not just hidden in Blade.
- Time log `client_visible_summary` is shown to clients instead of `work_summary` when `visibility=client_summary`. Always enforced in controller query, not only in Blade.
- Internal workspace messages and files are invisible to client/talent/observer roles — enforced in controller query filters and download access checks.
